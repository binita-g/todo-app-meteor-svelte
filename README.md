# todo-app-meteor-svelte
A simple To Do app built with Meteor and Svelte.

## Install Meteor and Svelte
Install Meteor here if need be: https://docs.meteor.com/install.html 

## Go to project directory
```
cd simple-todos-svelte
```

## Run the server locally
```
meteor run
```

You should now see the app running at http://localhost:3000/! 

## Using the App
To add a list item, enter an item (i.e. "Do laundry") into the input field and click the "Add" button.

To mark an item as done, click the checkbox.

To undo marking an item as done, just click the checkbox again.

To delete an item, press the "X" button.

To hide all completed tasks, click "Hide Completed".

## Extra Functionality
For the last segment of the rubric, the extra to-do list functionality added was the ability to show or hide all completed tasks. This is not typically part of a to-do implementation.
